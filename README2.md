Hello! All of my new files are marked with the number 5 after, and the purpose of my website is to serve as a personal archive
for some of my video and animation work. Unofortunately, my video files were too large to upload to Github, so I had to compress
them into lower quality versions of themselves. On my computer, the videos show up great, but I'm worried about how they look 
quality-wise to someone who downloads them from this repository.
